# Q1: Please explain different types of ANOVA tests along with real-time examples.
Ans: Types of ANOVA Test:-
1. One-Way ANOVA:- A one-way ANOVA has just one independent variable.
For example, difference in Corona cases can be assessed by Country, and Country can have 2, 20, or more different categories to compare.
2. Two-Way ANOVA:-A two-way ANOVA (are also called factorial ANOVA) refers to an ANOVA using two independent variables. 
Expanding the example above, a Two-way ANOVA can examine differences in Corona Cases (the dependent variable) by Age group (independent variable 1) and Gender (independent variable 2). Two-way ANOVA can be used to examine the interaction between the two independent variables. Interactions indicate that differences are not uniform across all categories of the independent variables. 
For example, Old Age Group may have higher Corona cases overall compared to Young Age group, but this difference could be greater (or less) in Asian countries compared to European countries.

3. N-Way ANOVA- A researcher can also use more than two independent variables, and this is an n-way ANOVA (with n being the number of  independent variables you have) aka MANOVA Test.
For example, potential differences in Corona cases can be examined by Country, Gender, Age group, Ethnicity, etc, simultaneously.
An ANOVA will give you a single (univariate) f-value while a MANOVA will give you a multivariate F value.
