# Q 2.1. What's the difference between Z- Test, and T- Test?
Ans:Z-tests and t-tests are statistical methods used for hypothesis testing, specifically for comparing sample means. However, there are key differences between the two, and the choice between them depends on certain conditions related to the data.

### 1. **Population Standard Deviation:**
   - **Z-Test:** Requires knowledge of the population standard deviation.
   - **T-Test:** Typically used when the population standard deviation is unknown and is estimated from the sample data.

### 2. **Sample Size:**
   - **Z-Test:** Ideally suited for large sample sizes (typically n > 30).
   - **T-Test:** More robust for small sample sizes. It is commonly used when dealing with samples less than 30.

### 3. **Distribution:**
   - **Z-Test:** Assumes a normal distribution of the data.
   - **T-Test:** More robust and can be used even when the distribution of the data is not perfectly normal, especially with larger sample sizes.

### 4. **Application:**
   - **Z-Test:** Typically used when the population parameters are known, or the sample size is large enough to assume normality.
   - **T-Test:** Preferred when dealing with smaller sample sizes or when the population standard deviation is unknown.

### 5. **Type of Data:**
   - **Z-Test:** Often used for interval or ratio data.
   - **T-Test:** Applicable to interval or ratio data and is commonly used when comparing means of two groups or assessing the significance of a single group mean.

### 6. **Degrees of Freedom:**
   - **Z-Test:** Does not involve degrees of freedom.
   - **T-Test:** Involves degrees of freedom, which is a parameter that adjusts for the sample size in small samples.

### 7. **Test Statistic:**
   - **Z-Test:** Uses the z-statistic, calculated as the difference between the sample mean and population mean divided by the standard error.
   - **T-Test:** Uses the t-statistic, calculated similarly but with the sample standard deviation replacing the unknown population standard deviation.

### 8. **Example:**
   - **Z-Test:** Used when comparing the average height of a sample to a known population average.
   - **T-Test:** Used when comparing the average exam scores of two different groups of students.

### 9. **When to Use Which Test:**
   - If the population standard deviation is known and the sample size is large, a Z-test is appropriate.
   - If the population standard deviation is unknown or the sample size is small, a t-test is often more suitable.

In summary, the choice between a Z-test and a t-test depends on the characteristics of the data, such as the sample size and knowledge of the population standard deviation. Z-tests are appropriate for larger samples with known population standard deviations, while t-tests are more versatile and can handle smaller sample sizes and situations where the population standard deviation is unknown.

# Q 4: Please share 5 real-time examples of each of the below ANOVA tests:
1. One-Way ANOVA Test
2. Two-Way ANOVA Test
3. M-ANOVA Test Test

Types of ANOVA Test:-

One-Way ANOVA:- A one-way ANOVA has just one independent variable. For example, difference in Corona cases can be assessed by Country, and Country can have 2, 20, or more different categories to compare.

Two-Way ANOVA:-A two-way ANOVA (are also called factorial ANOVA) refers to an ANOVA using two independent variables. Expanding the example above, a Two-way ANOVA can examine differences in Corona Cases (the dependent variable) by Age group (independent variable 1) and Gender (independent variable 2). Two-way ANOVA can be used to examine the interaction between the two independent variables. Interactions indicate that differences are not uniform across all categories of the independent variables. For example, Old Age Group may have higher Corona cases overall compared to Young Age group, but this difference could be greater (or less) in Asian countries compared to European countries.

M-Way ANOVA(Multivariate ANOVA)- A researcher can also use more than two independent variables, and this is an n-way ANOVA (with n being the number of independent variables you have) aka MANOVA Test. For example, potential differences in Corona cases can be examined by Country, Gender, Age group, Ethnicity, etc, simultaneously. An ANOVA will give you a single (univariate) f-value while a MANOVA will give you a multivariate F value.
